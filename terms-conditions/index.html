If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code § 1542, which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."<br /><br /><strong>13. Warranties and Disclaimer</strong><br /><br />Except as expressly provided by the applicable additional terms, the site and any content, products and services contained on the site, including links, are provided on an "as is" basis with no warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, TESOL disclaims all representations and warranties, express or implied, with respect to the site, the content, the products, the services, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, freedom from computer viruses or other malicious or unauthorized code or programs, and implied warranties arising from course of dealing or course of performance. In addition, TESOL does not represent or warrant that the information accessible via the site is accurate, complete or current.

Limitation of Liability</strong><br /><br />TESOL and its officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, licensors and third party partners will not be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages, or any damages whatsoever, whether or not TESOL has been previously advised of the possibility of such damages, whether in an action under contract, tort, or any other theory, arising out of or in connection with any errors or omissions, viruses or other malicious or unauthorized code or programs, the use, inability to use, or performance of the site or the content, products or services available from the site or any loss, business interruption or other damages in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, TESOL's liability in connection with the site, the content, the products, the services or these terms of use shall be limited to the amount paid for the site, the content, the products or services giving rise to the claim. These limitations will apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.<br /><br /><strong>15. Indemnification</strong><br /><br />You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless TESOL and its officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, licensors and third party partners from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs (collectively, "Damages"), including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from: (a) any violation by you of these Terms of Use or any applicable Additional Terms, and (b) any User Content provided by you.<br /><br /><strong>16. Dispute Resolution</strong><br /><br />If any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or related to your use of the Site, the Products and / or Services or any of the Content arises, the dispute will be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association. However, TESOL will have the right to petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the entry of injunctions and orders for specific performance relating to your unauthorized use, modification, copying, distribution, transmission, display, performance, reproduction, publication, license, creation of derivative works, transfer or sale of the Site, the Products, the Services, the Marks and / or the Content.<br /><br /><strong>17.

If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in effect.<br /><br /><strong>18. Miscellaneous</strong><br /><br />If any provision of these Terms of Use or any Additional Terms is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the effectiveness or validity of any provision in any other jurisdiction, and these Terms of Use or the applicable Additional Terms will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such provision had never been contained herein. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and TESOL as a result of these Terms of Use, any Additional Terms, our Privacy Policy or use of the Site, the Products and / or the Services. TESOL's performance of these Terms of Use and any Additional Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms of Use, any Additional Terms or our Privacy Policy is in derogation of TESOL's right to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by TESOL with respect to such use.
