                            <div class="text"><p><strong>What do you believe is a burning issue in TESOL today; what would you as a leader of the largest international association in the field plan to do about it?</strong></p>
<p>The challenge of TESOL today centers on connections and advocacy. As an international organization, recognizing the power of English as a language of wider communication with the potential to act as a force for good in the world, we must continue to find ways to reach out to many communities and constituencies, taking an additive, inclusive and respectful approach to language teaching and learning. Language can be a tool to foster collaboration in addressing issues such as climate change and conflicts. English language skills can provide new opportunities to immigrants and refugees, trying to find a new home.</p>
<p>To address these needs, I advocate broad outreach, harnessing the avenues of research and application through technology, working dynamically with Artificial intelligence to provide researched-based high-leverage practices to members, and infusing the affordances of technology with the humanism inherent in our organization and mission. We must grow TESOL's advocacy footprint domestically and globally by assuming a louder voice for multilingual communities. We must think creatively to prepare students for careers that do not yet exist to create a sound knowledge base and high-leverage practices for the skills needed in workforce development. Learning English combined with global citizenship skills allows future employees to work successfully with a diverse workforce able to find innovative solutions. As TESOL president, I will encourage new ways to support English teachers and learners to help enrich their lives and develop the tools for a successful existence as we face the many challenges of life in today’s world.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>Write a biographical statement in which you highlight your professional and leadership experiences.</strong></p>
<p>A few significant experiences can form a child’s identity: poverty, refugee life, lack of resources, and trauma; all are part of my autobiography. I arrived in the US at the age of 28, and learning English allowed me to define a new destiny for my life. In the U.S., I obtained degrees in World Languages and Education and found my career. This background and my trilingual tricultural family inform me as a professional, advocate, and human being.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate to be mentored by amazing professionals, many from TESOL. First, I served as Kentucky Affiliate president and have been active in a range of TESOL International leadership roles.  As a TESOL Executive Board member, my colleagues entrusted to me with the responsibility of being the finance committee chair during the most financially dangerous time of our organization’s history, where I worked with the Executive Director to successfully manage the financial crisis. I also participated in TESOL’s historical diversity initiative. As a senior TESOL leader, I have been building strong global connections with other affiliates, encouraging individuals with a promise to run for office, particularly those from non-native backgrounds. My leadership on The Seal of Biliteracy project has included creating and revising the guidelines and encouraging broad participation around the country and globally.</p>
<p>As president-elect, I will reach out to current and potential TESOL members, advocating for those in need and celebrating the continuous attainment of English by our sisters and brothers worldwide.</p></div>

<p>The Post-Pandemic TESOL International Association faces several challenges. First, the Association has made significant investment in technology upgrades that will pave the way for future progress and improve the membership and leadership experience. As President-Elect, I will collaborate with all stakeholders to ensure successful and sustainable implementation of this technology. Second, the Association has received tremendous support from the US Department of State, bringing in thousands of members from underserved parts of the world who have no experience with any type of professional association. We need to make sure we are providing programs and services that serve their needs. As President-Elect, I will work with the Membership Professional Council and others to create and maintain these programs and services, while continuing to serve established members. It is likely that many of those programs and services will include virtual offerings, and my expertise in online teaching and online course design may prove beneficial. Finally, TESOL has become known as an advocate for teachers and students of English as a new language in the United States. As the Association becomes more recognized around the world, we will have increased opportunities to advocate for our members outside of the United States by connecting with government agencies and organizations in other countries that provide programs and services for teachers and students of the English language. As President-Elect, I will strive to take advantage of these opportunities to improve the situations for our members worldwide.</p></div>

<p>As a member for many of the last 22 years, I have come to think of the TESOL International Association as a second home, and the members and volunteer leaders I have worked with as a second family. It is a place where English language teachers from any context in every part of the world can find connections and resources to further their career and improve their practice. During my service on the Board of Directors (2019 - 2022), I participated in many historical decisions facing the Association, including canceling the annual convention for the first time ever due to the Pandemic, establishing the Diverse Voices Task Force and later a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policy, and hiring a new Executive Director. Time has shown these actions to have had a significant positive impact on the well-being of the Association. We have an excellent professional staff that have sacrificed much and brought their best efforts to keeping the Association viable and even thriving to some degree during the Pandemic, despite financial and other complications. We have dedicated volunteer leaders serving throughout the Association who love the work and the comradery I’m sure as much as I do. As President-Elect, my goal would be to work with these wonderful people to fulfill the mission of the Association.</p></div>

<p>TESOL’s strength are its people. Not only are we great people-intrinsically-because teachers simply are great people! but TESOL people are all over the globe-and that’s a great resource to tap into. TESOL’s continued viability will come from building on its recent and growing success in the area of tailored professional learning, with content designed to meet the needs of members who work in extraordinarily diverse contexts and delivered in modes that allow us to serve our members and Affiliates all around the world. It’s important we live up to the international in our name TESOL International. I am also convinced that we have not reached saturation with our membership. We could do more to connect with teachers in the Asia-Pacific and Africa- and we have not tapped into the mainstream teacher market in Anglophone countries. These teachers of ELLs, often for the majority of the day and they struggle to manage their work with them. We need to think more strategically about how we market our association to them, providing publications and professional learning for teaching English in the mainstream. My own very personal passion is giving teachers voice. I believe it is important for professional associations to speak for teachers who may feel unable to speak out either by the politics of their contexts, or job security or lack of confidence.</p></div>

<p>I trained as an elementary school teacher with a love of visual arts, but in my first year of teaching I discovered a new love. The English language learners in my first-grade class. I loved them, I loved teaching them and I loved learning more about how to do that teaching more effectively. So, I did a TESOL specialization and then a Masters, and began working exclusively with new arrivals in Intensive Language Centres in Australia. It was a dream job, but then I moved to a dream location, Greece. In my search to understand more about my new country and my new profession, I joined TESOL Greece, a founding affiliate of TESOL International. Before I knew it I was the President of TESOL Greece! I learned much about different ways of getting work done in different geopolitical contexts and became a better intercultural communicator. I was elected onto TESOL’s Affiliate Leadership Council and met and worked with the most incredible TESOL affiliate leaders from around the globe. I learned what our common challenges are within our diverse contexts. I returned to Australia and was elected President of Australia’s TESOL Association, and I continued my Affiliate work with TESOL. I began lecturing and tutoring in Language, Literacy and TESOL at the University of Canberra. I completed my PhD and began a research and publishing journey. I am now an Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Canberra and a Principal Fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia.</p></div>

<p>One burning issue in the field of TESOL is the digital divide in language education. The rapid advancement of technology has created a significant gap in access to digital resources and opportunities for language learners. The pandemic accelerated this divide and made it deeper. Many students, especially those from disadvantaged communities or with limited resources, do not have adequate access to the internet, computers, or digital devices, hindering their ability to participate fully in online language learning platforms and digital language resources. This must change. We must have digital equity for all learners around the world. In addition with the addition of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we must help both teachers and students learn how to use this resource in an equitable and ethical way.</p>
<p>As a leader in TESOL, I would help professionals learn how to advocate for themselves to increase funding to bridge the divide. I would link practitioners to resources to help them understand how technology can be best assessed for more engaged learning. In addition, I would promote inclusive teaching practices that accommodate learners with limited access to digital resources. This may involve designing lesson plans that integrate both online and offline activities, utilizing printed materials, and creating alternative pathways for students to engage with language learning outside of digital platforms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would prioritize low cost professional development for educators to enhance their digital literacy skills and ensure they are equipped to navigate the digital landscape effectively. I believe that narrowing the digital divide will help more learners collaborate more competitively in a global environment.</p></div>

<p>As a strong supporter of equal access and appreciation of the diversity of perspectives, I believe that the burning issue in TESOL today is to increase global membership and provide multiple opportunities for professional growth to those who have limited access to resources. I will advocate for a population of teachers who are hungry to learn more and help them with equal access to resources via technology-integrated opportunities. With an Internet connection and mobile access availability, teachers do have access to TESOL resources, but they don’t have experience navigating a global community of practice. Creating a feeling of belonging and connectedness among TESOL members can be a way to invite more members from across the globe. Building a virtual community of practice (somewhat different from myTESOL) can be the project to keep sustainable membership growth if current members invite new members. This virtual community can be centrally facilitated by TESOL interest groups and affiliates every month. This virtual community can be created based on the principles of best practices to provide access to remote members who can’t travel to TESOL on-site events.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>After graduating with Ph.D. in Learning Design and Technology from Purdue University in 2011, I worked as a senior instructional designer at George Mason University. Prior, I taught English as a Foreign Language at North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk, Russia for more than 15 years. I received a Doctoral Degree in Education from Yakutsk State University, Yakutsk, Russia in 1999. Currently, I am a Clinical Assistant Professor of Educational Technology at the University of Florida. I have been actively involved in professional<br />associations, such as TESOL International and AECT (Association for Educational Computing and Technology) not only as a member but also serve in several leadership positions, i.e., President of the Division of Distance Learning at AECT and the Chair of the TESOL Affiliate Leadership Council (ALC). I am a manuscript reviewer for TESOL Quarterly with a focus on technology-integrated language learning.</p>
<p>Currently, I am on the coordination team at TESOL Electronic Village Online (EVO). My research focuses on distance education and online presence. I have authored or co-authored 1 book, 12 peer-reviewed journal articles, and 11 book chapters to date in addition to other publications, and have presented over 30 sessions at regional, state, national, and international conferences. My contribution is recognized by awards by the Online Learning Consortium (OLC) Effective Practice Award, the Association of Educational Communications and Technology (AECT), by Blackboard/Anthology Catalyst Award for Teaching and Practice, and by the American Educational Research Association (AERA). I currently serve on the Editorial Board of the Online Learning Journal.</p></div>

<p><br />As a member of the TESOL Association for several years. I have witnessed several changes in the profession. Recently, the pandemic brought rapid changes to the ELT field. I have always considered English teachers as innovators who are eager to embrace change. However, there are teachers who have not had the opportunity to keep pace with all these sudden changes. As a leader, I would look for equal opportunities for all teachers. I would also enhance open discussions on the role of technology and AI in the field of English teaching and learning. I have seen that some teachers still see AI as a threat to the profession and their jobs, but for me, they are opportunities to facilitate our work. I would encourage advocacy for all unequal situations either by social practices, gender, or economy. I firmly believe that if we keep TESOL strong and united, we could reach higher and more significant goals which can benefit all its members in the personal and professional areas. The recognition of the emotions, values and knowledge of all members of TESOL is a burning issue in ELT. Most of all, the acknowledgement and appreciation of the human side of each person in the Association will shape a better understanding among members and, hopefully, a better future for humankind. After all. English teachers are educating the future generations around the world.</p></div>

<p>We live in an increasingly global and multicultural world, and our teaching communities reflect this diversity, which is our strength. Yet, we lose this strength when we undervalue difference and uphold racist or discriminatory policies and practices in our workplace. A burning issue today is that many diverse educators feel marginalized, unappreciated, and undervalued. Our field and TESOL International Association should continue to strive to foster educational environments where different perspectives are recognized, acknowledged, respected, and seen as a source of knowledge, strength, and value. TESOL’s mission is to advance professional expertise in English language teaching worldwide; hence, it needs to reach, support, and engage all the members of our diverse workforce and ensure an inclusive environment for all and at all levels of the association.</p>
<p>Through my service as TESOL’s Chair of an interest section and the Nominating Committee, I have witnessed how proactively TESOL works to promote equitable and diverse representation, engagement, and access to professional learning opportunities and to eliminate any kind of discrimination and social injustice based on individual differences, including language background, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, culture, religion, belief, age, and geographic location. Yet, there is more to be done. I am a multicultural and multilingual scholar with strong expertise in language learning and teaching. I fully embrace TESOL’s vision and mission. I can substantially contribute to TESOL’s efforts to promote a healthy intellectual community, enriched and enhanced by diversity, appreciation for difference, understanding of otherness, and inclusivity.</p></div>

<p><br />TESOL needs a blend of leaders in the elected leadership that reflects its commitment to diversity, equity inclusion, and access. The Nominating Committee operationalizes this by developing a slate of nominees for president, the Board and the Nominating Committee itself, notably taking into account the range of voices on the current Board. While the association needs the wisdom that comes from experience and the invigorating energy of younger members, our leadership must also reflect the wide diversity of racial, social, cultural, geographic and personal identities that compose our membership. May it suffice for me to quote my 2003 Baltimore Convention Theme: Hearing Every Voice. In our diversity is our strength; leadership develops solutions to our challenges through hearing diverse viewpoints. While recognizing the limitations and shortcomings of a digital world, we need leadership who embrace technology and who can help guide the association in harnessing it for professional development.<br /><br />I would like to serve TESOL on the Nominating Committee because of my years of experience in leadership with the association, and my familiarity with a wide range of issues and challenges facing TESOL – the association and the field. With decades of experience reading CVs and job applications, I have the experience necessary to vet materials from prospective nominees. Finally, as a retiree, I have the time to dedicate to the task. Your consideration of my Expression of Interest is appreciated.</p></div>

<p><br />TESOL needs leaders that strike the right balance between a firm commitment to the organization’s values and openness to the innovation that comes from varying viewpoints. Identifying what change aligns with your own and the organization’s principles requires deep knowledge of the group and the kind of instinct that only comes with many years of experience. TESOL leaders should also have a strong affinity with the wide variety of members they serve. As an organization with members from all over the world, TESOL has long acknowledged the need for diversity in its leadership pipeline, to ensure that its leaders truly represent the perspectives of its members. Growing up speaking Portuguese, most of my English came from Brazilian teachers, who inspired me to become a teacher myself. I was thrilled to later learn that I, a foreign L2 English speaker, could teach the language in the land of Uncle Sam. Most English speakers in the world use English as an additional language and rely on other multilingual speakers to learn it. This is therefore a population that must be represented at TESOL and I will do my best to actively recruit the most qualified among these and other underrepresented professionals to run to be elected leaders. Having participated in search committees and local politics, I understand that qualifications alone are not enough to meet the wider needs of a community and will also be mindful of</p></div>

<p>In my current role working with graduate students as Senior Lector in the Center for Language Study at Yale University, I can combine my desire to learn new things with my passion for languages. I have been a teacher since I entered the Universidade de Sao Paulo for a BA in English and Portuguese in 1994. While pursuing an MA (Universidade Estadual de Campinas), then PhD (University of Connecticut), in syntax, I never stopped teaching: ESL, Linguistics, writing. As an international teaching assistant (ITA) at UConn, I realized the power of appropriate support. Although I had considerable English teaching experience, teaching in higher education in a foreign country required the kind of pragmatic and cultural familiarity that I could not have acquired by myself. At UConn, Cornell University, and now at Yale, I have had the privilege of extending this kind of support to new ITAs, while also working to remove the gate-keeping stigma often associated with this kind of work. My proudest achievement at TESOL has been to be Chair of the ITA Interest Section, working with other dedicated professionals to advocate for multilingual students to be the best they can be in their careers while having their own Englishes respected and cherished. Throughout my career, I have been actively sharing successful initiatives and outcomes derived from action research at national and regional events. Outside academia, I have been active in local politics to have a stronger voice in my town’s election process.</p></div>

<p><u>Diverse Cultural Background</u></p>
<p>I have a diverse cultural background, having been born and raised in the UK, growing up in Saudi Arabia, and later moving to Sudan as an adult. This has taught me how to value equity, diversity, and inclusion, respecting all backgrounds and this is a core value of the TESOL Association.</p>
<p><u>Lifelong Learner</u></p>
<p>I am a lifelong learner, and my application for this position reflects my belief that learning never ends. I have progressed from a TESOL member to a member of the PDPC to the Chair, and now seek to join the nominating committee.</p>
<p><u>Leadership Skills</u></p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have consistently sought out new opportunities to learn and grow as a TESOL professional. Over the years, I have been involved in numerous associations and  held various leadership positions within the TESOL International community and beyond. These experiences have equipped me with the skills, abilities, and knowledge necessary to join the Nominating Committee.</p>
<p><u>Networking</u></p>
<p>I am a strong candidate for the nominating committee due to my extensive social media network of over 30,000 contacts. My active participation in both online and in-person events worldwide has increased my visibility, allowing me to locate potential candidates through my networking skills.</p>
<p>I am confident in my ability to choose leaders due to my extensive experience in various leadership positions within different associations. Specifically, I have been a member of TESOL International since 2014, which has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of what qualities make a good leader.</p></div>

I have worked in the international sector for over three decades both overseas and in the US in the private sector and at the community college and university levels. As the Director of a robust English language program at California State University, Northridge, I worked with university senior staff, embassies, and international institutions building unique programs and collaborating on university policies that advocate for international students. I have also conducted research on assessment and student success and have been instrumental in changing international student admissions policies at the university. I have been active in professional organizations at the state, national and international levels holding executive board positions and have served on multiple nominating committees. I believe that my years of expertise as a English language program administrator and my commitment to TESOL and other professional organizations have equipped me with the skills that make a strong candidate for the nominating committee.</p></div>

<p>TESOL International needs leaders that first and foremost understand and reflect the needs of our global community. We have a quite diverse board right now, so we are getting there. However, we really need a leadership board that understands how to really exhibit and demonstrate TESOL 365 - and not just TESOL before, during, and after the annual convention. Leaders need to encourage and support ways that councils and other communities of practice try to build engagement and member value for all TESOL members, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>We need leaders who can help the executive committee to find ideas to diversify our revenue so that we do not have to rely so much on the convention to make sure we stay in the green. We need leaders who cannot just represent but understand and advocate for multilingual learners from across the world. We need leaders who can help to encourage and spread research and scholarship and make this accessible to as many teachers as possible across the globe.</p>
<p>As for me, I am an excellent candidate to help choose these leaders because I have a solid understanding of the mission, vision, and strategic plan of TESOL having served as an IS, PLN, and council chair. I also live in an area without an affiliate - and without live regional opportunities, so I understand the needs of members (and future members) who NEED that virtual connection as other options might be limited due to political and otherwise reasons.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>What do you believe is a burning issue in TESOL today; what would you as a leader of the largest international association in the field plan to do about it?</strong></p>
<p>My leadership philosophy centers on, “Leaders become great not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others” (John Maxwell). As a first-generation college graduate who came out of a small village without a school and reached out to the other parts of the world as a Fulbrighter to empower others in a way in which I was empowered by my English teachers, I believe a TESOL leader should have three main attributes. First, a TESOL leader should be diverse and global to understand each team member who may bring different educational cultures and perspectives to the table. Next, a TESOL leader should be empowering others and should consider others’ opinions and perspectives involved in a collaborative project. A TESOL leader should be professional and establish new benchmarks and goals to achieve the aforementioned attributes while maintaining individual responsibility for executive operations. As an international multilingual TESOL leader, I am diverse and inclusive in any sense and open to any cross-cultural circumstances that may rise due to cultural differences. I focus on team members’ innate potential to leverage their unique talents and I motivate them to overcome challenges by providing constructive feedback to maintain the constant change or transformation. I am grateful to all inspiring leaders in my life who are diverse, inclusive, professional, and transformational. Devoting my time and energy to transform TESOL team members’ lives will always be my passion and I will always move forward with this transformational vision and drive.</p></div>

<p>The leaders are the ones who have both vision and compassion. They need the vision to lead the association to create strategic goals for promoting equitable representation, engagement, and access to professional opportunities for all members regardless of their linguistic backgrounds and identities. Equally important, leaders need to create a space of compassion and togetherness for all members and staff to co-learn and work with one another. The leaders are those who are willing to listen to the stories and diverse needs of members as well as be ready to engage in uncomfortable conversations to grow and provide necessary changes. Both vision and compassion are significantly needed to shape the leadership of an association.</p>
<p>I will not <em>choose </em>the leaders, but I am willing to work with them to support and provoke their potential and hidden leadership. In other words, I do not choose them, but I will create a space to learn about and with them so that they would be able to discover themselves and decide how we can become leaders with vision and compassion. I am patient, perseverant, and willing to walk the walk in exploring the path of leadership together.</p></div>

<p>Many years in education, TESOL France and other associations has helped me to see how good people in leadership roles makes everything work better. Divisiveness and those only making a name for themselves destroys.</p>
<p>Our association needs leaders who can:</p>
<ul>
<li>see beyond themselves because the work will continue after us.</li>
<li>see beyond the association and yet see how it connects so many dots in education and leadership.</li>
<li>can connect to people and not fear their baggage and yet push for good things and all those it touches directly and indirectly: the good, the bad and the challenges.</li>
<li>are not based on the level of their degrees but their advocacy to and for the other.</li>
<li>uses their education to know the trends and needs for future generations who will come into roles of teaching, administrating and leading.</li>
<li>need to be fully aware and sensitive to the real-life issues facing us each day: racism, sexism, bullying, phobias, culture etc.., which then affect how we currently interact with others and prepare future leaders.</li>
<li>imperatively lead others to open taboo subjects when others hide or pretend that these sensitive issues do not exist. Language and our leaders must go beyond words to actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually being pretty good at suggesting transparent people for different roles, I know there are those who can be encouraged to see and act on the skills they may not see in themselves. I can help seek out those leaders for our association’s needs.</p></div>

<p>My involvement in student associations as a UC Berkeley student gave me a foundation of how I would see leadership in its different roles, including leading small groups in associative activities.</p>
<p>Working, it was through teaching French, creating a community college class, helping create a study abroad program, as well as a non-credit ESL program, I got involved with their professional associations linked with many opportunities to work with international students in the US and France:</p>
<ul>
<li>FLE association (teaching French as a Foreign Language),</li>
<li>NAFSA (National Association for Foreign Student Advisors)</li>
<li>the past 15 years or so TESOL (France and International, as well as our sister associations and IATEFL) in different roles of leadership and support.</li>
</ul>
<p>In TESOL France, as a volunteer, and quickly targeted as someone who wanted to give to others, I was brought onto EXCOM leading to several roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young learners worldwide spelling contest</li>
<li>Workshop Coordinator (15yrs or so),</li>
<li>Vice President (3yrs),</li>
<li>President (3yrs),</li>
<li>board member (conference coordinator, membership committee, selection committee, exhibitor coordination) (15yrs or so).</li>
</ul>
<p>Attending sister associations through:<br />by giving workshops,<br />being invited as a guest speaker,<br />helping judge their organized contests,<br />being a plenary speaker.</p>
<p>In TESOL International, I have had opportunities with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Affiliates Leadership Council, then establishing the Affiliates Network Professional Council,</li>
<li>Initiating new registration policies for those volunteers in TESOL,</li>
<li>being in Reviewing process of the many conference proposals,</li>
<li>contributing to other committees like the Conference Professional Council.</li>
