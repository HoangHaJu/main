<p>With the rapidly changing ELT landscape, the key issue affecting our profession is the impact of technology on our practices, especially as it affects teachers in low-tech regions of the world. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has altered how we approach language teaching in the classroom, therefore, standardizing its use in the classroom is a challenge, and TESOL, as the leading authority in the field, can provide guidance. TESOL, through the Standards Professional Council, can suggest good affordances to further not complicate AI use in the classrooms for the benefit of our global members.</p>
<p>As TESOL President with strong background in EFL, resulting from my experiences of teaching in the Asian, Arab, African and European contexts where variations abound, I know the challenges firsthand and would work with the Board to explore how our AI-enriched tech platform can be readily accessible to members especially those in low-tech and multilingual contexts. I would leverage on the goodwill of TESOL partners and also forge new partnerships in our quest to give our members the competencies to grow as TESOL professionals.</p>
<p>Although TESOL cannot impose policies on educational authorities around the world, our ELT advocacy efforts would be geared towards aligning global perspectives with local practices and thus contributing to and influencing educational policies in the wider global context. As TESOL President that wears a broader international lens, I can work with the Board to positively address these challenges. This is my full promise to you, and trust me to deliver.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>Write a biographical statement in which you highlight your professional and leadership experiences.</strong></p>
<p>I joined TESOL Board in 2020 at a time the global economy took a hit from the Covid19 pandemic, and TESOL was not spared from this economic downturn. I served on the Finance Committee and became chair in 2022. With astuteness and effective collaboration with the investment advisory and accounting firms, TESOL’s 2023 budget had a net surplus.</p>
<p>I also believe in the “goose that lays the golden eggs” concept, and as chair-elect of Diversity &amp; Inclusion Committee, we successfully advocated for affordable K-12 Day for our US based members, which was priced at $100.</p>
<p>I founded Africa ELTA (formerly Africa TESOL) in 2015 with 4 affiliates to support teachers in Africa who had been largely excluded from the mainstream ELT community. I was president (2017-2019), and with resilience, exemplary team spirit, and zero dollar, Africa ELTA now has 25 affiliate countries and 3000 members in 94 countries.</p>
<p>Membership of Africa ELTA is free and many teachers in Africa are availing themselves of the PD opportunities the association offers. To date, it has held eight annual conferences and I was program co-chair for five of these.</p>
<p>I was president of Qatar TESOL (2014-2015), and won $31,500 grant from Qatar National Research Fund to organize its 2015 conference.</p>
<p>I chaired the conference committee of my Program at Qatar University where I led a team of 20+ colleagues to organize eight successive and successful conferences. Above are testimony to my leadership and teamworking skills aimed at achieving positive outcomes whatever the challenge.</p></div>

<p>The world and ELT are rapidly evolving in a globalized economy where knowledge and lifelong learning are crucial for economic growth. Educators and learners must acquire new skills to adapt to these changes and the demands of a competitive present and an unpredictable future, ensuring effective teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Teacher education is key in this context. It must address these needs and prepare lifelong learning professionals in ELT, equipping them to teach English and foster responsible global citizenship, intercultural communication competence, and soft skills to enhance employability.</p>
<p>The integration of technology and the scarcity of English language teachers present significant challenges. The digital divide and lack of technological training hinder effective teaching, while the shortage of qualified teachers strains the education system. Addressing these issues is crucial for equitable, high-quality language education.</p>
<p>TESOL International Association plays a vital role by offering high-quality online teacher development opportunities and promoting policies to support multilingual learners and lifelong learning for teachers. TESOL’s initiatives on these critical issues contribute to advancing the ELT field globally, ensuring educators are well-equipped to navigate the evolving educational landscape.</p>
<p>As an EFL educator with over 35 years of experience and a committed member of TESOL International Association and its Argentine affiliate ARTESOL, as well as a member of the  Association of Binational Centers in Latin America (ABLA), I believe I can bring diverse voices to the board, helping the association reach and support ELT professionals and students in diverse contexts.</p></div>

<p>TESOL needs leaders who create positive impact among members, those who can show and guide new generations to fulfill its mission and values. Those who can redirect it to meet new challenges, contexts, and realities.</p>
<p>I believe a burning issue and challenge is the use of Artificial Intelligence and how we want to include it in the many projects and programs TESOL offers to its membership. We also need to analyze how it should be included in administrative tasks. Ethical and copyrights  issues must be met, we want to be practical and respectful of international laws.</p>
<p>As a leader I will invite Board members, experts, and stakeholders to debate about the right use of it and find ways to incorporate it. We may also find a way to reduce costs and generate revenue by simplifying processes. If it happens we could allocate a bigger budget to benefit members in disadvantaged conditions.</p>
<p>Regarding members, TESOL could offer training, webinars, or AI courses, so this tool have a global reach among ELT professionals that otherwise would be left out.</p>
<p>AI is here to stay and it is growing fast, as leaders we must anticipate the positive and / or negative consequences it brings to TESOL, teachers, schools, learners and everyone involved in the field.</p></div>

<p>Our world has experienced drastic changes in a relatively short time, putting a spotlight on already existing issues of identity in our field: who is our focus when we say “teachers” of multilingual learners of English (MLEs), and what do we mean by "teaching".</p>
<p>English language teachers/specialists do not and should not work in a vacuum as they are not the only ones educating and affecting the education of MLEs. Additionally, English teaching today is not relegated to four walls nor is it solely about linguistic systems. Counseling, liaising between communities and schools, translating for families, and/or advocating at classroom and law-making levels may be part of our job though not part of our formal training.</p>
<p>My extensive collaborative work bridges the trifecta of practice, research, and policymaking across educational contexts throughout the world. I’ve had the unique perspective of being part of change from the bottom-up and the top-down and realizing both must happen simultaneously for equitable change to occur, and all stakeholders must take part.</p>
<p>As a leader in the most historically influential association in our field, I would foster new initiatives promoting extensive outreach to those beyond the official title of EL teacher/specialist who are key stakeholders in MLE success to become part of TESOL and collaborate in strategic planning. I would also encourage regular town halls across the globe to hear from members on-the-ground about their teaching roles/expectations evolution to help TESOL better strategize how to lead the field into tomorrow.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>Write a biographical statement in which you highlight your professional and leadership experiences.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Drew Fagan and I am a scholar, educator, and advocate for multilingual learners of English (MLEs) and all who contribute to their language success. I have been in the TESOL field for ~25 years as an ESOL teacher and teacher educator in diverse educational settings across the USA, Japan, China, Spain, and Mexico, and was the first English Teaching Assistant Fulbright Fellow to the Slovak Republic. My professional philosophy is that for MLEs to be successful, all stakeholders connected to these learners (teachers, policymakers, administrators, publishers, researchers, etc…) must come out of their siloes and collaborate.</p>
<p>Currently, I am Clinical Professor of Applied Linguistics and Language Education at the University of Maryland, where I oversee programs engaging non-traditional TESOL students in our field. For example, I direct (and developed) the state’s first Ed.D. in School System Leadership Program- TESOL and Dual Language Education Specialization for K-12 school system administrators specifically.</p>
<p>While I have published and presented extensively in research and practitioner-oriented settings, I also engage my work outside of these traditional arenas. As the 2022-2023 Maryland TESOL President, I co-established the first state-wide mentorship program for TESOL professionals. I also work closely with Maryland's Legislature and State Department of Education (MSDE) to enact change related to MLEs' equitable education access, including recently collaborating with policymakers towards the passage of the Credit for All Language Learning (CALL) Act and being appointed by Maryland’s State Superintendent to be the MLE Education Lead on the K-12 curriculum-wide Accountability/Assessment Task Force.</p></div>

<p>My academic and professional trajectory is deeply rooted in the belief that all English learners (ELs), regardless of ethnicity or national origin, possess invaluable cultural knowledge, experiences, and perspectives.  Elevating the voices and positions of ELs in a globalized world where political agendas and personal biases often undermine the power of diversity and inclusion is a critical issue that I am committed to addressing through advocacy, strategic program development, and fostering inclusive communication practices.</p>
<p>This commitment aligns with the growing recognition of the importance of a diverse leadership pipeline within organizations serving highly diverse populations.  Reflection of the served population in leadership structures is essential for ensuring effective representation and responsiveness to the unique needs and aspirations of ELs.  Several strategies can contribute to diversifying leadership within organizations serving ELs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversifying Networks and Partnerships:  Building strategic partnerships with organizations and individuals who represent the diverse demographics of the EL community  fosters a broader and more inclusive perspective in leadership decision-making.</li>
<li>Building Member Value and Engagement: Developing programs and initiatives that foster a sense of ownership and engagement among ELs empowers them to participate actively in shaping the organization's direction and advocating for their needs.</li>
<li>Diversifying Funding Sources: Strategically diversifying funding sources reduces reliance on any single funding entity, thereby creating an opportunity for greater autonomy and flexibility in pursuing initiatives that elevate the voices and positions of ELs.</li>

<p>A critical issue facing TESOL International Association today is ensuring it remains relevant in a rapidly changing educational landscape while maintaining a robust leadership pipeline. TESOL must continuously adapt to emerging trends, such as technological advancements, shifting educational policies, and diverse learner needs, to stay at the forefront of English language teaching.</p>
<p>To address this, I would focus on two key initiatives aligned with TESOL's strategic goals:</p>
<p>Innovation and Adaptability: TESOL should continually innovate and adapt to the changing times by integrating cutting-edge technologies (like AI) and methodologies in ELT. By doing so, TESOL ensures it meets the evolving needs of multilingual learners, enhances the effectiveness and reach of our professional development offerings, supports teachers globally, and positions TESOL as a beacon of knowledge in the world.</p>
<p>Leadership Development: Continue to develop and mentor emerging leaders within the TESOL community through the initiatives of the MPC. Offer targeted training, mentorship opportunities, and leadership pathways to ensure a steady flow of capable leaders aligned with the association's strategic direction. Encourage more members to become leaders, as this will help sustain the association in the future, building a diverse pipeline of leaders ready to navigate future challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>By focusing on innovation, and leadership development, we can ensure TESOL remains a dynamic and relevant force in the field of English language teaching. As a leader, I am committed to driving these initiatives forward, fostering a vibrant and forward-thinking TESOL community that continues to set the standard for excellence in ELT.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>What do you believe is a burning issue in TESOL today; what would you as a leader of the largest international association in the field plan to do about it?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most burning issues in TESOL today is the digital divide that affects both educators and learners. The rapid shift to online and hybrid learning environments, accelerated by the pandemic, has highlighted significant disparities in access to technology as  well as digital literacy skills. These disparities can hinder the effectiveness of language instruction and widen the gap between different learner populations.</p>
<p>As a potential board member of the TESOL International Association, I would prioritize addressing the digital divide by suggesting professional development workshops, webinars, and online courses that focus on integrating technology into language instruction effectively. Further the creation of culturally responsive digital learning materials around artificial intelligence is not only needed but should be encouraged. I believe that the best way to do this would be to foster a supportive community where educators can share best practices, resources, and experiences related to digital teaching and learning--something TESOL is already well-established in. </p>
<p>Also, I believe we will need to advocate for policies that promote the benefits of TESOL teachers in education at the local, national, and international levels when it comes to instruction with artificial intelligence. By advocating now, we can help educational bodies to influence policy to ensure teachers have a place in the classroom and continue to be at the forefront of education.</p>
<p>By addressing the digital divide, TESOL can ensure that all learners have the opportunity to succeed in an increasingly digital world, fulfilling our mission of advancing excellence in English language teaching.</p></div>

<p>With over 20 years of experience in ESL education, I bring a wealth of expertise and a proven commitment to advancing the field. My career includes co-authoring the well-received ESL textbook Academic Inquiry 2, and the workbook for the O Canada series both published by Oxford University Press Canada in 2018 and 2012 respectively. These works reflect my dedication to creating high-quality educational resources that meet the evolving needs of learners and educators.</p>
<p>Active in the TESL/TESOL community, I have held several leadership roles that have shaped my approach to advocacy and professional development. I served as Chair of the TESL Ontario Board from 2015 to 2017, where I led initiatives to enhance teacher support and elevate the standards of ESL education in the province. My tenure as Chair of the Affiliate Network and Professional Council for TESOL International further honed my skills in building collaborative networks and driving strategic initiatives. Additionally, my experience serving on the TESOL Nominating Board two years ago has given me insight into the governance and strategic planning necessary for the continued growth and success of our organization.</p>
<p>Currently, I contribute to the field through my role on the Centre for Canadian Language Benchmarks (2019-present), where I help promote the government benchmarks that are crucial for language assessment and curriculum development.</p>
<p>Through these roles, I have demonstrated a commitment to excellence, innovation, and inclusivity in ESL education. I am eager to bring my experience and strategic vision to the TESOL International Association Board of Directors. </p></div>

<p>TESOL requires leaders who can effectively share their experiences and foster unity across its diverse membership.</p>
<p>With over twenty years deeply immersed in TESOL, serving in roles such as newsletter editor and council member, I have developed a profound understanding of the organization's operations and member dynamics. This experience enables me to offer clear guidance and support, ensuring effective leadership within TESOL.</p>
<p>Beyond operational insights, TESOL requires leaders who can unite its global community. My background in international EFL settings has equipped me to recognize and advocate for diverse educational needs across cultural contexts. I am committed to promoting inclusive practices that enhance collaboration and mutual learning among members beyond traditional conference settings.</p>
<p>I am a strong candidate for the Nominating Committee due to my demonstrated ability to attentively listen to TESOL members and understand their perspectives. Effective leadership in TESOL demands empathy, strong communication skills, and a genuine dedication to serving the community. I am committed to amplifying member voices and ensuring that our leadership embodies the inclusive values essential to TESOL's mission.</p>
<p>Through my experience and dedication, I aim to contribute significantly to the Nominating Committee's role in selecting leaders who will guide TESOL towards continued excellence in English language teaching worldwide.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>Write a biographical statement in which you highlight your professional and leadership experiences.</strong></p>
<p>Having taught English for nearly 20 years, I entered this career due to my love of language. I enjoy incorporating movies and digital media into lessons, making grammar and vocabulary come alive for students. Additionally, I have strong interests in language assessment, material development, and integrating MOOC technology into my teaching methods.</p>
<p>Seeking to grow and advance my career, I began attending the annual TESOL convention after completing my studies in the US and returning to Taipei, Taiwan, to teach. Long Beach, California, was my first TESOL convention. Over the years, I have made many good friends and learned extensively through these conventions. My involvement deepened as I edited "Video News," the VDMIS newsletter, served as Chair of VDMIS, and became a member of the Conferences Professional Council and the Professional Development Professional Council. These experiences have been some of the most rewarding in my career.</p>
<p>Beyond teaching, I have conducted teacher workshops and developed educational materials. This journey has taught me how to handle various classroom situations and accommodate diverse needs. My international perspective, gained through my studies and professional interactions, has enriched my approach to teaching and collaboration within TESOL. Passing on my love of language and sharing my teaching experiences are among my favorite aspects of this profession.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>What kind of leaders does the association need? Why are you a good candidate to choose them?</strong></p>
<p>TESOL needs leaders who have diverse cultural backgrounds to bring their unique experiences to the table.</p>
<p>I have a diverse cultural background, having been born and raised in the UK, growing up in Saudi , and later moving to Sudan.This has taught me how to value equity, diversity, and inclusion, respecting all backgrounds and this is a core value of the TESOL Association.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to have leaders who are committed to lifelong learning.</p>
<p>I am a lifelong learner, and my application for this position reflects my belief that learning never ends. I have progressed from a TESOL member to a member of the PDPC to the Chair, and now seek to join the nominating committee.</p>
<p>The association needs experienced leaders:</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have consistently sought out new opportunities to learn and grow as a TESOL professional. I have been involved in numerous associations and have held various leadership positions within the TESOL International community and beyond. These experiences have equipped me with the skills, abilities, and knowledge necessary to join the Nominating Committee.</p>
<p>The association needs leaders with networking capabilities</p>
<p>I am a strong candidate for the nominating committee due to my extensive social media network of over 30,000 contacts. My active participation in both online and in-person events worldwide has increased my visibility, allowing me to locate potential candidates through my networking skills.I am confident in my ability to choose leaders due to my extensive experience in various leadership positions within different associations.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>What kind of leaders does the association need? Why are you a good candidate to choose them?</strong></p>
<p>I am a good candidate to serve on the Nominating Committee. For example, once elected as Chair of the English as a Foreign Language Interest Section (EFL IS), I surveyed meeting attendees, conference presenters, and attendees at the EFL IS Business Meeting to find prospective leaders. I invited viable candidates to submit the election paperwork.</p>
<p>As the new Chair-elect, I organized an EFL IS dinner at the annual conference. I made the reservation at the restaurant and advertised the event by email, requesting that interested parties make a reservation. The members knew this was not a last-minute search for some eatery that happened to be open. A couple of days before our Tuesday night dinner, which was our Business Meeting, the officers and friends of the EFL also recruited attendees for dinner. Many became EFL IS officers. One such attendee told me last year that his career took off after meeting me and attending the dinner. He is now running for a TESOL Executive Officer position. I encouraged past officers to be newsletter officers or community liaisons so they could be a resource for the new EFL IS Chair. The elected Chairs continued these practices for many years after my term ended. When leading a group for Team TESOL, I remember that a good leader is a good listener who encourages others to speak up. A good leader lets colleagues know that their ideas and contributions are valuable. A good leader acknowledges the contributor of interesting and important comments during a discussion.</p></div>

<p>I have led an extensive career as an English as a Foreign Language instructor in universities in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>My professional biography is published in the 2023 Marquis Who’s Who edition.</p>

<li>Featured SIT alum, Education and Social Change 2024. https://graduate.sit.edu/about/career-impact/.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having served in various leadership roles in the TESOL International Association, I was elected to the TESOL Board of Directors in 2008. Before this, I was President of TESOL Arabia in the United Arab Emirates, where I practiced leadership through motivation, high energy, enthusiasm, and a strong understanding of others. As a life coach certified by the International Coach Federation, I support leaders and educators in exploring and cultivating their personal landscape. My strong social conscience inspired me to provide service in a global context. Volunteering for the Peace Corps, I taught EFL in African universities. As an English Language Specialist consulting for the U.S. State Department, I conducted teacher training workshops in India, Bahrain, Egypt, and Oman. What inspires me as an educator is bearing witness to that moment in the classroom where knowledge meets action, and the process named learning empowers yet another student.</p></div>

<p>TESOL needs leaders who can both be good stewards and visionaries. I use the word stewards because TESOL carries a rich legacy and history that needs to be preserved and celebrated. At the same time, a good steward may critically examine its achievements and shortcomings, and provide an innovative path forward into the future. To do that, a TESOL leader needs to be knowledgeable, competent, flexible, and appreciative of diverse viewpoints and positionalities.</p>
<p>To be part of the selection process of future TESOL leaders is an honor and a huge responsibility. While I believe my competencies and skills reflect the ones described as required for this volunteer role, it is also my hope that my own positionalities, identities, and experiences can be of help in supporting my prospective role as a member of the Nominating Committee.</p></div>

<p>The TESOL International Association needs visionary yet pragmatic leaders who are culturally responsive and able to navigate the complexities of an increasingly globalized and digital educational landscape. These leaders must demonstrate a deep understanding of the diverse needs of TESOL professionals and learners across different contexts. They should be committed to advancing equity, inclusivity, and innovation within the association and the broader TESOL community.</p>
<p>As a candidate for the Nominating Committee, I bring a wealth of experience and a unique perspective that aligns with the association’s needs. With a background in education and leadership roles across various institutions, I have developed a keen eye for recognizing and fostering leadership potential. My extensive experience in curriculum development, nonprofit leadership, and international collaborations has equipped me with the skills to identify leaders who can drive the association forward while staying true to its core values.</p>
<p>Moreover, my commitment to professional development and mentoring within the TESOL community demonstrates my dedication to supporting the next generation of leaders. I understand the importance of selecting leaders who not only have the qualifications but also the passion and vision to inspire and lead with integrity. My ability to discern these qualities in candidates makes me a strong choice for the Nominating Committee.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>What kind of leaders does the association need? Why are you a good candidate to choose them?</strong></p>
<p>The TESOL International Association needs leaders who embody diversity, empowerment, and professionalism to navigate the complexities of our global educational landscape. These leaders must understand and appreciate the diverse cultural and educational backgrounds of our members, fostering an inclusive environment where every voice is valued.</p>
<p>As a first-generation college graduate and a former ELL with learning disability, I deeply resonate with the transformative power of education. My leadership philosophy, inspired by John Maxwell, emphasizes empowerment over power, believing that great leaders uplift others to achieve collective success.</p>
<p>I bring to the table a wealth of international experience and a commitment to inclusivity. My tenure as a TESOL leader has shown my dedication to empowering colleagues and students alike, leveraging their unique talents to achieve shared goals. I believe in setting high standards while maintaining accountability and transparency in executive operations.</p>
<p>My journey has been shaped by diverse mentors who instilled in me the values of inclusivity, professionalism, and transformational leadership. I am honored to continue their legacy by fostering a culture within TESOL that embraces diversity, values collaboration, and strives for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>As a candidate for the Nominating Committee, I am prepared to identify and advocate for leaders who embody these principles, ensuring that TESOL continues to advance its mission of promoting excellence in English language teaching and learning worldwide. Together, we will empower educators and learners alike to thrive in a rapidly changing global environment.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>What kind of leaders does the association need? Why are you a good candidate to choose them?</strong></p>
<p>TESOL International Association needs leaders that are committed, innovative, and visionary. This would require creating a balance between achieving the goals and vision of the association while showing openness to newer and innovative ideas that can come from research, consultation with diverse stakeholders (e.g., members, leaders, governments), and enhancing leadership skills through training, learning, and reflecting. The diversity of the membership is the backbone of the association. This comes in the form of multilingual learners and multicultural teachers. TESOL’s leadership should be able to accommodate, promote, and support this diversity through its actions and policies.</p>
<p>The current vision of the association to advance expertise in English language teaching to support multilingual and multicultural learners aligns with my personal views, teaching interests, and research engagements. I have co-edited two volumes that focus on policy development for a multilingual TESOL and am working on a third one to de-/re-construct power ‘in’, ‘of’, and ‘for’ language classrooms. Additionally, I have published journal articles and presented at international conferences advocating for multilingual learners. As a TESOL leader, I will continue to support the association’s mission and will participate in the recruitment of future leaders that share its values, principles, and strategic plan.</p></div>

                            <div class="text"><p><strong>Write a biographical statement in which you highlight your professional and leadership experiences.</strong></p>
<p>I am a multidisciplinary researcher with academic and professional background in law, English language teaching, and higher education. With more than a decade long teaching experience, I have worked with learners from diverse backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, and communities. These experiences have shaped my teaching and research that is focused on multilingual, inclusive, and student-focused education. They have also improved my independence and teamwork skills.</p>
<p>I have a passion for community service and have been involved within TESOL and beyond as a volunteer. At UCalgary, I have served on multiple student committees and supported research projects focused on inclusive governance, multilingual education, and inclusive pedagogies. Within TESOL, my proudest achievement is serving as a co-chair for the Governance Review Working Group where I was able to utilize my legal, educational, and leadership skills to make recommendations to the Board for aligning the performance of the communities of practice with the strategic plan of the association. Similarly, serving TESOL as a co-chair for Program Administration intersection allowed me to utilize my leadership experience and research on TESOL leadership to prepare future leaders, enhance leadership skills of language program leaders, and offer professional development opportunities for aspiring leaders.</p></div>
